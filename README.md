Modules for week 1

Crowdfunding Report:
1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
•	The most popular categories for crowdfunding are theater, film & video, and music.
•	Overall, a little over half or 56% of campaigns are successful. With journalism and technology focused campaigns having the highest chance of success based on this data set.
•	Theater plays are by far the most popular crowdfunding campaigns. They make up approximately 34% of all campaigns.
•	It is best time to include the summer months of May – July during your crowdfunding campaign. Over time July has the highest number of successful campaigns.
•	Crowdfunding projects are most common in the USA

2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?

•	The number of countries are limited to just seven. We don’t know how big or little crowdfunding might be in other countries.
•	The data only covers 2010 to 2019. It would be interesting to see this data tracked across the financial crisis in 2008 & 2009 or ever the dot.com bubble in the early 00’s.
•	The location data only being at the country level is pretty limiting if someone wanted to use targeted ads to support their campaign.

3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

•	You could examine whether or not the Spotlight or Staff Picks correlate with a higher than average rate of success or failure. Roughly, it doesn’t look like they have much effect.
•	Examine successful campaigns by country to see if the rate of success varies among the seven countries. If someone had the choice of country to focus they could use this information to decide where they want to target their crowdfunding.
•	Examine total amount pledged by each country per category. This could help guide future campaigns to decide where and what types of campaigns to consider.
